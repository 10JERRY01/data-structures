Q: Why does this work? Why are we allowed the change the structure of a tree like this?

A: This is perhaps one of the best questions to ask about tree rotations. The answer 
is that 'there are two things to remember, first that' (cut?) all BBST are BST, so the BST
invariant holds meaning that the values in left subtrees are always less than the ndoe
and the values in the right subtree are less than the vlaue in the node *. 



* assumming unique values in the tree.
