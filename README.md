## The Data Structures

All the data structures provided in this repository (spare a few) have been designed for educational proposes. This is why you will find extensive comments explaining code snippets throughout. These data structures are associated with a video series on data structures which explains how each data structure works, please check out the associated [youtube video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu)

## Using the Data Structures

Each data structure is found in its own folder with associated tests. The data structures provided do not have any dependencies outside their own files, so just copy the code and have fun! You may also find that sometimes multiple versions of a data structure exist (i.e, A queue implemented as a linked list but also a queue implemented with an array), this is because sometimes one implementation may be more preferable to another.
